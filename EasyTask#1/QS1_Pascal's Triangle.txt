Pascal's Triangle

APPROACH:-

Input : Taking input from the user for no of rows(n) of the pascal triangle's.

outer loop: a loop run for creating 's' no of rows.

adding space: a for loop for printing the space in each row by the formula (n - i (from outer loop which increases) -1) since in the first row we need n-1 space in second row n-2 space and so on

inner loop : 
	(i)for each row we run a loop from 0 to i(row's number since each row of pascal 	triangle contain the no of element equal to the row's number)
	(ii) first element for each row is 1.
	     and the following element are compute by ((ans*(i-j))/(j+1)) where ans is the 	     previous value(ans)


Time Complexity:O(n^2)due to the nested loops iterating over rows and values in the rows.
Space Complexity: O(1) since only a few variables are used and no extra space is required for storing the triangle.
