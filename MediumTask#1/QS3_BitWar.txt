BitWar

APPROACH:-
The program reads two long integers, left and right, which define the range for which the bitwise AND needs to be calculated.
The function rangeBitwiseMax initializes a variable result to left.
It then iterates from left + 1 to right, applying the bitwise AND operation (&&) between result and each number in that range.
The loop continues until it reaches right, updating result with the AND of itself and the current number in each iteration.

Time Complexity:O(rightâˆ’left) due to the loop iterating through the range.
Space Complexity: O(1) since it doesn't store data in intermediate state.
