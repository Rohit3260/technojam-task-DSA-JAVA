Climbing Stairs

APPROACH:-
Base Cases:

If there are fewer than 3 steps (n < 3), the function returns n directly. 
If n = 0, there are 0 ways to climb.
If n = 1, there is 1 way (one single step).
If n = 2, there are 2 ways (two single steps or one double step).

Use a loop starting from the 3rd stair up to the n-th stair:
For each stair i, the number of ways to reach it is the sum of the ways to reach the two previous stairs:
stairsClimbed = forLastStair + forSecondLast

Update the variables for the next iteration:
Set forSecondLast to the value of forLastStair.
Set forLastStair to stairsClimbed.

Time Complexity: O(n) due to a single loop iterating through the number of stairs.
Space Complexity: O(1) because it doesn't store intermediate data
